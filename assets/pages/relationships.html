            Relationships are tricky but somehow other people seem to be working it out, why not you?
            You question yourself: Why does this always happen? What’s wrong with me? Why do I always end up feeling this
            way?<br><br>
            You are intelligent, and charming – what is going on? Why do the same patterns keep happening and why do you
            keep ending up on your own or in a relationship that isn’t really working for you, causing you to feel stressed,
            anxious and walking on eggshells?<br><br>
            Something needs to change, but what?<br><br>
            Often, we make decisions based on our experiences in childhood, teenage years and adult life, and they sink into
            our subconscious mind and create patterns that are designed to protect us from being hurt. However, a lot of the
            time those decisions and patterns were made when we were quite young and they no longer serve us, or they may
            reflect our parent’s patterns but are not helpful in our world. In fact, they actively seem to hurt us and keep
            us from what it is we want in life and love.<br><br>
            We can work together to uncover those aspects of you that maybe blocking you, creating resistance, or trapping
            you in old patterns. With these insights we can change your patterns, build your confidence, self-esteem and
            self-trust and break the hold of the past.<br><br>
            You deserve to have a great relationship that meets your highest needs. Let’s get you ready for one.
