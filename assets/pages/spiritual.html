            If you think of yourself as a spiritual person then this approach could be helpful for you. Working at an
            energetic level we can shift the patterns of the past and help you to reclaim your personal power, joy,
            confidence and vitality.<br><br>
            Sometimes working at the cognitive (thought), and behavioural levels is not enough to shift old energy patterns
            from early childhood and life experiences. If you feel like you have tried everything, and nothing seems to have
            changed then maybe we need to work at a different level.<br><br>
            During our early years we are like sponges just soaking up everything around us. This includes the positive
            traits of those close to us, but also their fears, their anxieties, guilt, sadness, anger, hopelessness and
            trauma, low self-confidence etc.<br><br>
            These emotions form part of our blueprint and can affect our attitudes, emotions, health outlook and
            relationships. Working with your inner child, your shadow side and the energy imprints of those people who may
            have cause you some kind of trauma in the past (parents, teacher, friends, ex-partners) we can safely release
            negative patterns of energy that no longer serve you as you move forward in your life.<br><br>
