						You know the feeling: overwhelm, stress, frozen with fear on the inside, mind either racing or
						going blank or a strange combination of the two â€“ it sucks, and it is not really you. Therapy
						will help you to gain insight into your underlying anxiety thought patterns and we will develop
						tailored action steps for you to step forward and beat this.

					<p>
						You want to be in a relationship that really works for you and yet it is not happening.<br><br>
						You feel stressed and anxious and that is not how it is supposed to be.
						Orâ€¦.. you are in a relationship that just isnâ€™t flowing for you, or maybe your relationship is
						creating a lot of stress for you, maybe you are in love with a Narcissist? You know that
						something is wrong but you just canâ€™t figure it out. Is it you? Is it them?<br><br>
						Maybe you are single. You know that you are a great package and yet something always seems to go
						wrong. Possibly, you fall for people who end up hurting you, or perhaps you just canâ€™t get a
						relationship to the next level. Or you are stuck in a bad relationship , and want to fix it or
						move on. You want these patterns to stop but you donâ€™t know what it is exactly that is going
						wrong.

					<p>
						Sometimes the more usual methods of Psychology just arenâ€™t enough to shift the patterns in your
						life.<br><br>
						If you are stuck in a relationship (past or present) and have tried everything to get over it ,
						or you have patterns of behaviours that really do not work for but no matter what you do they do
						not change then we can work at a different level.<br><br>
						Spiritual Psychology is about working with your inner child, your deep-seated fears, the shadow
						self as well as energetic bonds and contracts that no longer serve you and are in fact holding
						you back. This kind of therapy is not applicable for everyone â€“ only if it calls to you and you
						want that something extra that is a little bit different.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>	Before I tell you a bit about me, I want to talk about you.<br><br>

			Why? Well because I know how hard it is reach out and ask for help and you want to be sure that I am the
			right person for you.<br><br>

			It takes a lot courage to make the call and ask a stranger (which is basically what I am until our first
			session ðŸ˜Š) to help you gain clarity, insight and understanding. It takes guts. I get it and I feel
			honoured by every one of my clients who makes that call.<br><br>

			You want to feel supported, respected and understood so that you feel safe enough to be able to open up,
			and tell your story. You want to know that you can trust that this person is there for you and no matter
			what it is you need to talk about that they will be able to help and support you.<br><br>

			So before I tell you all about my credentials and skills I want to explain the kind of client I tend to
			have the most success helping so that you can decide if we will be a good fit, because this is all about
			you, not me!<br><br>

			The clients who are most successful in therapy with me are the ones who really want something to change
			and they are ready to take action and do the work needed to do to make the changes that they need to
			change, understanding that therapy is often not a quick fix.<br><br>

			I am straight-forward, kind and compassionate and I wonâ€™t tip-toe around your issues. Therapy with me is
			quite active and you will be given tasks to do between sessions (I call it homework :-D). These tasks
			involve you learning more about your own patterns of behaviour and thinking and then we work together to
			dive deep and create different options for you. Sometimes there will be tears, sometimes there will be
			laughter, sometimes both, but I can guarantee you will always leave feeling better than when you came
			in.<br><br>

			With over 20 years of experience and multiple qualifications I know that I can help you gain insight and
			create action steps to make the changes that you want to see.<br><br>
