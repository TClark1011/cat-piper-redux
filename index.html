				You wake up feeling stressed with those thoughts running through your mind,
				your body begins to tense.
				<br><br>
				You feel scared, or just unfulfilled. <span class="highlight">This may</span>
				not <span
					class="highlight">be</span> in every area of your life, <span
					class="highlight">because of course there
					are
					things that you enjoy and things that you are good at</span>, but those
				feelings are there, and you just
				want them to
				go away.
				<br><br>
				Perhaps you feel on edge and worried that someone is going to discover that
				you are not the person that they think you are.
				<br><br>
				You are sick and tired of the way you feel, and you know that something has
				to change because this is really
				not
				working for you.
				<br><br>
				You are ready. Ready to get off the rollercoaster that <span
					class="highlight">exists in your mind</span> so
				that you can enjoy all
				aspects of your life.
				<br><br>
				If you are sick of feeling stressed, anxious, or paralysed by perfectionism
				or fear and you want things to
				change then <span class="highlight">you have come to the right place</span>.

				Let me help you gain Insight into what is going on and take Action to

						Hi there, I am Cat Piper and I would be honoured to help you Gain Insight
						and take Action to alleviate your
						Anxiety. (link Learn more about Me) (photo of Me)
						<br><br>
						Let me make this as easy for you as possible.
						<br><br>
						Simply by sending me a text message, email or leaving me a voicemail (I
						know that this can be hard for some
						people but all you have to say is ‚ÄúHi, my name is ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. my number is ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. and
						I am interested in talking to
						you about counselling‚Äù) and we can get the ball rolling.
						<br><br>
						I promise to call or text you back as soon as I can ‚Äì it may be in the
						evening or the next morning as I am
						usually with a client, but I will get back to you within 24 hours and we
						can make a time to meet if you feel
						comfortable talking with me.
						Also I do facetime, skype or zoom sessions if you are unable to get to my
						office üòä
						<br><br>
						It really is that easy!

								You want to be in a relationship that really works for you and yet it is
								not happening. You feel
								stressed and anxious and that is not how it is supposed to be.
								<br><br>
								Or... you are in a relationship that just isn‚Äôt flowing for you, or
								maybe your relationship is
								creating a lot of stress for <span>you</span>. You know that something is wrong but
								you just can‚Äôt figure it
								out. Is it you? Is it them?
								<br><br>
								Maybe you are single. You know that you are a great package and yet
								something always seems to go
								wrong. Possibly, you fall for people who end up hurting you, or perhaps
								you just can‚Äôt get a
								relationship to the next level. Or you are stuck in a bad relationship.
								<span>Maybe you are involved with a Narcissist?</span>
								You want these patterns to stop but you don‚Äôt know what it is
								exactly that is going wrong.

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p class="body"> Before I tell you a bit about me, I want to talk about you.<br><br>

					Why? Well because I know how hard it is reach out and ask for help and you
					want to be sure that I am the
					right person for you.<br><br>

					It takes a lot courage to make the call and ask a stranger (which is
					basically what I am until our first
					session üòä) to help you gain clarity, insight and understanding. It takes
					guts. I get it and I feel
					honoured by every one of my clients who makes that call.<br><br>

					You want to feel supported, respected and understood so that you feel safe
					enough to be able to open up,
					and tell your story. You want to know that you can trust that this person
					is there for you and no matter
					what it is you need to talk about that they will be able to help and
					support you.<br><br>

					So before I tell you all about my credentials and skills I want to explain
					the kind of client I tend to
					have the most success helping so that you can decide if we will be a good
					fit, because this is all about
					you, not me!<br><br>

					The clients who are most successful in therapy with me are the ones who
					really want something to change
					and they are ready to take action and do the work needed to do to make the
					changes that they need to
					change, understanding that therapy is often not a quick fix.<br><br>

					I am straight-forward, kind and compassionate and I won‚Äôt tip-toe around
					your issues. Therapy with me is
					quite active and you will be given tasks to do between sessions (I call it
					homework :-D). These tasks
					involve you learning more about your own patterns of behaviour and thinking
					and then we work together to
					dive deep and create different options for you. Sometimes there will be
					tears, sometimes there will be
					laughter, sometimes both, but I can guarantee you will always leave feeling
					better than when you came
					in.<br><br>

					With over 20 years of experience and multiple qualifications I know that I
					can help you gain insight and
					create action steps to make the changes that you want to see.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>My credentials:</p>
				<ul id=credentials>
					<li>Bachelor of Arts Majoring in Psychology (Macquaire University)</li>
					<li>Master of Psychology (UNSW) </li>
					<li>Master of Psychotherapy (JNI) </li>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<div id=questions>
					<div id=questionsInner>
						<div class=question>
							<h3 class=questionTitle>Where are you located?</h3>
							<p class=questionBody>My office is on Holtermann St, Crows Nest. There is
								2 hour free parking
								available at the Holtermann St Carpark ‚Äì only a short 3 minute walk from
								my office. It is a 12
								minute walk from St Leonards railway station and there is a bus stop at
								the corner of Holtermann
								St and Willoughby Rd (a 4 minute walk to my office)</p>
						</div>
						<div class=question>
							<h3 class=questionTitle>Do you have evening appointments available?</h3>
							<p class=questionBody>Yes, however they are usually booked out a month in
								advance, so if you can
								come during the day, I can fit you in much sooner. Remember I can also
								do zoom, skype or
								facetime sessions if you can‚Äôt physically get to my office.</p>
						</div>
						<div class=question>
							<h3 class=questionTitle>Do you see couples?</h3>
							<p class=questionBody>No ‚Äì I work with individuals ‚Äì While I do
								relationship counselling I tend to
								help individuals deal with their personal problems in figuring out why
								their relationship is not
								working, or why it is that they have certain patterns that have created
								problems for them in
								getting a relationship that really honours them.</p>
						</div>
						<div class=question>
							<h3 class=questionTitle>How long does therapy last?</h3>
							<p class=questionBody>Each session goes for approximately 50 minutes.<br><br>
								Overall, therapy as a process, will last for as long as you want and
								need it too. I want to give
								you what you need and get you on your way.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class=question>
							<h3 class=questionTitle>How much do you charge?</h3>
							<p class=questionBody>I charge the recommended fee for a senior
								psychologist and that is $240.00 per
								session. You will get over $100 back through Medicare if you use a
								Mental Health Plan.</p>
						</div>
						<div class=question>
							<h3 class=questionTitle>Do I need a Mental Health Plan?</h3>
							<p class=questionBody>If you would like to receive Medicare benefits then
								yes you do. <br><br>
								It is easy to get a Mental Health Plan ‚Äì you just ask your GP for one.
								<br><br>
								Please note that over half my clients do not use a Mental Health Care
								plan because they do not
								want a record of their psychological sessions going onto the Health
								system. This is usually
								because they are in a fairly high position in their work life. The
								decision is completely up to
								you.
