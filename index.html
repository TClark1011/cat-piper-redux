						You know the feeling: overwhelm, stress, frozen with fear on the inside, mind either racing or
						going blank or a strange combination of the two â€“ it sucks, and it is not really you. Therapy
						will help you to gain insight into your underlying anxiety thought patterns and we will develop
						tailored action steps for you to step forward and beat this.

					</a>
					<p>
						You want to be in a relationship that really works for you and yet it is not happening.<br><br>
						You feel stressed and anxious and that is not how it is supposed to be.
						Orâ€¦.. you are in a relationship that just isnâ€™t flowing for you, or maybe your relationship is
						creating a lot of stress for you, maybe you are in love with a Narcissist? You know that
						something is wrong but you just canâ€™t figure it out. Is it you? Is it them?<br><br>
						Maybe you are single. You know that you are a great package and yet something always seems to go
						wrong. Possibly, you fall for people who end up hurting you, or perhaps you just canâ€™t get a
						relationship to the next level. Or you are stuck in a bad relationship , and want to fix it or
						move on. You want these patterns to stop but you donâ€™t know what it is exactly that is going
						wrong.

						<h3 class=specialtyTitle>Spiritual Psychology</h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						Sometimes the more usual methods of Psychology just arenâ€™t enough to shift the patterns in your
						life.<br><br>
						If you are stuck in a relationship (past or present) and have tried everything to get over it ,
						or you have patterns of behaviours that really do not work for but no matter what you do they do
						not change then we can work at a different level.<br><br>
						Spiritual Psychology is about working with your inner child, your deep-seated fears, the shadow
						self as well as energetic bonds and contracts that no longer serve you and are in fact holding
						you back. This kind of therapy is not applicable for everyone â€“ only if it calls to you and you
						want that something extra that is a little bit different.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Before I tell you a bit about me, I want to talk about you.<br><br>

			Why? Well because I know how hard it is reach out and ask for help and you want to be sure that I am the
			right person for you.<br><br>

			It takes a lot courage to make the call and ask a stranger (which is basically what I am until our first
			session ðŸ˜Š) to help you gain clarity, insight and understanding. It takes guts. I get it and I feel
			honoured by every one of my clients who makes that call.<br><br>

			You want to feel supported, respected and understood so that you feel safe enough to be able to open up,
			and tell your story. You want to know that you can trust that this person is there for you and no matter
			what it is you need to talk about that they will be able to help and support you.<br><br>

			So before I tell you all about my credentials and skills I want to explain the kind of client I tend to
			have the most success helping so that you can decide if we will be a good fit, because this is all about
			you, not me!<br><br>

			The clients who are most successful in therapy with me are the ones who really want something to change
			and they are ready to take action and do the work needed to do to make the changes that they need to
			change, understanding that therapy is often not a quick fix.<br><br>

			I am straight-forward, kind and compassionate and I wonâ€™t tip-toe around your issues. Therapy with me is
			quite active and you will be given tasks to do between sessions (I call it homework :-D). These tasks
			involve you learning more about your own patterns of behaviour and thinking and then we work together to
			dive deep and create different options for you. Sometimes there will be tears, sometimes there will be
			laughter, sometimes both, but I can guarantee you will always leave feeling better than when you came
			in.<br><br>

			With over 20 years of experience and multiple qualifications I know that I can help you gain insight and
			create action steps to make the changes that you want to see.<br><br>
		</p>

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<div id=questions>
			<div id=questionsInner>
				<div class=question>
					<h3 class=questionTitle>Where are you located?</h3>
					<p class=questionBody>My office is on Holtermann St, Crows Nest. There is 2 hour free parking
						available at the Holtermann St Carpark â€“ only a short 3 minute walk from my office. It is a 12
						minute walk from St Leonards railway station and there is a bus stop at the corner of Holtermann
						St and Willoughby Rd (a 4 minute walk to my office)</p>
				</div>
				<div class=question>
					<h3 class=questionTitle>Do you have evening appointments available?</h3>
					<p class=questionBody>Yes, however they are usually booked out a month in advance, so if you can
						come during the day, I can fit you in much sooner. Remember I can also do zoom, skype or
						facetime sessions if you canâ€™t physically get to my office.</p>
				</div>
				<div class=question>
					<h3 class=questionTitle>Do you see couples?</h3>
					<p class=questionBody>No â€“ I work with individuals â€“ While I do relationship counselling I tend to
						help individuals deal with their personal problems in figuring out why their relationship is not
						working, or why it is that they have certain patterns that have created problems for them in
						getting a relationship that really honours them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class=question>
					<h3 class=questionTitle>How long does therapy last?</h3>
					<p class=questionBody>Each session goes for approximately 50 minutes.<br><br>
						Overall, therapy as a process, will last for as long as you want and need it too. I want to give
						you what you need and get you on your way.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class=question>
					<h3 class=questionTitle>How much do you charge?</h3>
					<p class=questionBody>I charge the recommended fee for a senior psychologist and that is $240.00 per
						session. You will get over $100 back through Medicare if you use a Mental Health Plan.</p>
				</div>
				<div class=question>
					<h3 class=questionTitle>Do I need a Mental Health Plan?</h3>
					<p class=questionBody>If you would like to receive Medicare benefits then yes you do. <br><br>
						It is easy to get a Mental Health Plan â€“ you just ask your GP for one. <br><br>
						Please note that over half my clients do not use a Mental Health Care plan because they do not
						want a record of their psychological sessions going onto the Health system. This is usually
						because they are in a fairly high position in their work life. The decision is completely up to
						you.
