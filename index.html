				You wake up feeling stressed with those thoughts running through your mind,
				your body begins to tense.
				<br><br>
				You feel scared, or just unfulfilled. This may not be in every area of your
				life, because of course there are things that you enjoy and things that you
				are good at, but those feelings are there, and you just want them to go
				away.
				<br><br>
				Perhaps you feel on edge and worried that someone is going to discover that
				you are not the person that they think you are.
				<br><br>
				You are sick and tired of the way you feel, and you know that something has
				to change because this is really
				not
				working for you.
				<br><br>
				You are ready. Ready to get off the rollercoaster that <span
					class="highlight">exists in your mind</span> so
				that you can enjoy all
				aspects of your life.
				<br><br>
				If you are sick of feeling stressed, anxious, or paralysed by perfectionism
				or fear and you want things to
				change then <span class="highlight">you have come to the right place</span>.
				<br><br>
				Let me help you gain Insight into what is going on and take Action to
				resolve it.

					Hi there, I am Cat Piper and I would be honoured to help you Gain Insight
					and take Action to alleviate your
					Anxiety. (link Learn more about Me) (photo of Me)
					<br><br>
					Let me make this as easy for you as possible.
					<br><br>
					Simply by sending me a text message, email or leaving me a voicemail (I
					know that this can be hard for some
					people but all you have to say is “Hi, my name is …….. my number is ……. and
					I am interested in talking to
					you about counselling”) and we can get the ball rolling.
					<br><br>
					I promise to call or text you back as soon as I can – it may be in the
					evening or the next morning as I am
					usually with a client, but I will get back to you within 24 hours and we
					can make a time to meet if you feel
					comfortable talking with me.
					Also I do facetime, skype or zoom sessions if you are unable to get to my
					office 😊
					<br><br>
					It really is that easy!
					<br><br>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p class="body">
					Before I tell you a bit about me, I want to talk about you.
					Why? Well because I know how hard it is to reach out and ask for help and
					you
					want to be sure that I am the right person for you.
					<br><br>
					It takes a lot of courage to make the call and ask a stranger (which is
					basically what I am until our first session 😊) to help you gain clarity,
					insight and understanding. It takes guts. I get it and I feel honoured by
					every one of my clients who makes that call.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<div class="inner">
					<p class="body">
						You want to feel supported, respected and understood so that you feel safe
						enough to be able to open up, and tell your story. You want to know that you
						can trust that this person is there for you and no matter what it is you
						need to talk about that they will be able to help and support you.
						<br><br>
						So before I tell you all about my credentials and skills I want to explain
						the kind of client I tend to have the most success helping so that you can
						decide if we will be a good fit, <span class="highlight">because this is all
							about you, not me!</span>
						<br><br>
						The clients who are most successful in therapy with me are the ones who
						<span class="highlight">really want something to change</span> and they are
						ready to <span class="highlight">take action</span> and <span
							class="highlight">do the
							work</span> needed to do to make the changes that they need to change,
						understanding that therapy is often not a quick fix.
						<br><br>
					</p>
					<img alt-text="me" src="images/cat-portrait-2.jpg">
				</div>
				<p class="body">
					I am straight-forward, kind and compassionate and I won’t tip-toe around
					your issues. Therapy with me is quite active and you will be given tasks to
					do between sessions (I call it homework :-D). These tasks involve you
					learning more about your own patterns of behaviour and thinking and then we
					work together to dive deep and create different options for you. Sometimes
					there will be tears, sometimes there will be laughter, sometimes both, but I
					can guarantee you will always leave feeling better than when you came in.
					<br><br>
					With over 20 years of experience and multiple qualifications I know that I
					can help you gain insight and create action steps to make the changes that
					you want to see.

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<div id="questions">
				<div id="questionsInner">
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="questionTitle">Where are you located?</h3>
						<p class="questionBody">My office is on Holtermann St, Crows Nest. There
							is 2 hour free parking available at the Holtermann St Carpark – only a
							short 3 minute walk from my office. It is a 12 minute walk from St
							Leonards railway station and there is a bus stop at the corner of
							Holtermann St and Willoughby Rd (a 4 minute walk to my office)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="questionTitle">Do you have evening appointments available?</h3>
						<p class="questionBody">Yes, however they are usually booked out a month
							in advance, so if you can come during the day, I can fit you in much
							sooner. Remember I can also do zoom, skype or facetime sessions if you
							can’t physically get to my office.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="questionTitle">Do you see couples?</h3>
						<p class="questionBody">No – I work with individuals – While I do
							relationship counselling I tend to help individuals deal with their
							personal problems in figuring out why their relationship is not working,
							or why it is that they have certain patterns that have created problems
							for them in getting a relationship that really honours them.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="questionTitle">How long does therapy last?</h3>
						<p class="questionBody">Each session goes for approximately 50 minutes.<br><br>
							Overall, therapy as a process, will last for as long as you want and
							need it too. I want to give
							you what you need and get you on your way.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="questionTitle">How much do you charge?</h3>
						<p class="questionBody">I charge the recommended fee for a senior
							psychologist and that is $240.00 per
							session. You will get over $100 back through Medicare if you use a
							Mental Health Plan.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="questionTitle">Do I need a Mental Health Plan?</h3>
						<p class="questionBody">If you would like to receive Medicare benefits
							then
							yes you do. <br><br>
							It is easy to get a Mental Health Plan – you just ask your GP for one.
							<br><br>
							Please note that over half my clients do not use a Mental Health Care
							plan because they prefer not to. The
							decision is completely up to
							you.
